# Julián

**Julián** is my first game developed for a **game jam** during my first year of university. Since I wasn't familiar with any other game engines at the time, it was created using **Adventure Game Studio**. 

### About the Project

The theme of the game jam was "Three Rules," and the timeframe for the project was just one weekend. This experience allowed me to learn the fundamentals of game development and design under a tight deadline.

### Features
- Developed using Adventure Game Studio.
- Themed around the concept of "Three Rules."
- Created within a weekend as part of a game jam.

### Technologies
- **Adventure Game Studio**
